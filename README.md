# Health-care-Data Analysis
##**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset using SQL to generate valuable insights for hospitals, insurance providers, and medical professionals. The dataset contains 55,500 patient records, including demographics, medical conditions, billing details, hospital stays, and insurance information.
### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**.It contains information on **hospital records, patient demographics, treatments, and costs**.  
### Tools
- Excel- Data cleaning
- MYSQL Server- Data Analysis
- Power BI-  Preparing Dashboard and Reports
- ### Data cleaning
  1. Data loading
  2. Removing Duplicates
  3. Converting  Data Types
  4.  Final Validation
     ### Exploratory Analysis
  Exploratory Data Analysis involves the  process of examining and summarizing data . In this project, EDA helped us understand and answer  questions such as:
  - What is the Average Billing Amount per Admission Type?
  - What is the Total Patients per Hospital?
  - What is the Average Stay Duration by Hospital?
  - Whata are the Top 5 Doctors with Highest Revenue?
  -  What is the Rolling Average of Billing Amount?
   ### Data Analysis
 ``` sql
SELECT Admission_Type, AVG(Billing_Amount) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare.healthcare_dataset 
GROUP BY Admission_Type;
SELECT Hospital, COUNT(*) AS Patient_Count
FROM  healthcare.healthcare_dataset 
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Patient_Count DESC;

SELECT  Hospital, 
    AVG(DATEDIFF(Discharge_Date, Date_of_Admission)) AS Avg_Stay_Days
FROM healthcare_data
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Avg_Stay_Days DESC;

SELECT  Doctor, 
    SUM(Billing_Amount) AS Total_Revenue
FROM healthcare.healthcare_dataset 
GROUP BY Doctor
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT  Name, 
    `Date of Admission`, 
    LAG(`Date of Admission`) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY `Date of Admission`) AS Previous_Admission,
    LEAD(`Date of Admission`) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY `Date of Admission`) AS Next_Admission
FROM healthcare.healthcare_dataset;
 
SELECT  `Date of Admission`, 
    `Billing Amount`, 
    AVG(`Billing Amount`) OVER (ORDER BY `Date of Admission` ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Moving_Avg
FROM healthcare.healthcare_dataset; ```

##Findings
The following are the findings from the  health-Care -Dataset:

1. LTD Smith Hospital has the highest number of admissions with 34 patients, followed by PLC Smith hospital with 30 patients.

2. Peterson-Powell hospital  has the longest average stay of 1775 days, while 'Cox-Sullivan' hospital has the shortest with 532 days.

3.Top 5 Doctors with the Highest Revenue include Dr. John Doe ,Dr. Jane Smith , Dr. Emily Johnson ,Dr. Kevin Williams and Dr. Mark Davi

4. The 7-day moving average for billing shows peaks during flu seasons and holiday periods, suggesting increased hospital visits.

###Recommendations
- To Managing High Patient Admissions Efficiently,LTD Smith Hospital and PLC Smith Hospital which has the highest admissions should ensure there is adequate staffing, especially during peak admission periods.

- Peterson-Powell Hospital which has the longest average stay should investigate Causes of Extended Stay and conduct audits.

- All hospitals should ensure flu vaccines, medications, and beds are well-stocked before peak seasons.

- All hospitals should recognize top-performing doctors with bonuses or career advancement opportunities.

### Limitations
- The dataset only covered a short period hence the performance of the hosp[itals  may not be fully captured.
- I never had previous yearsâ€™ data, so it was  difficult to assess whether trends are new or recurring.
